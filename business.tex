\section{Vision statement}

Our mission is to bring a mid priced, sweet cider to the people of India... stuff
about that 

We will begin by buying raw ingredients, materials and manufacturing the cider
for distributors. 

We hope to gain popularity in major establishments, in delhi and mumbai through 
the open minded youth and bar owners.

Our cider will become a desired commodity through exclusivity and we will be
able to research our market further at this point with minimal risk.

We will adapt and pick up popularity and scale up to make it available to the
public.
