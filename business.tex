\section{Product and systems development plans}
In order to setup a stable and longlasting infrastructure for our business we must take into consideration all the stages and requirements of production. This outlines a coherent development plan as follows.

	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Factory \\
When deciding about our homebase we considered two main criteria. The first regards our situation as a new company without assets. This brought the decision of renting out the factory bulding and equipment. The second criteria regards our main ingrediant requirements. Apples in India are available in the region of Himachal Pradesh. \\

For these reasons we will set our factory near Shimla, capital of Himachal Pradesh and rent the space and equipment necessary for production \\

\textbf{Quantities and Workforce} \\
For our marketing plan we require a relatively small production volume.\\
Workforce availability. \\

\textbf{Quality control}
We must ensure a good quality especially because it is a new product for this market..

	\item Suppliers
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Apple supply \\
			Buy from local farmers %who?
        	Sell residue back to farmers for animals (or agree on lower price)
		\item (Potentially) mango, berries, pares etc. suppliers
		\item Water supply \\
			Divine Waters, Foods Beverages
		\item Sugar supply %who?
		\item Bottling \\
			Home brewers use beer bottles, which work perfectly well, and are inexpensive. This allows the cider to become naturally carbonated.
		\end{itemize}
			
\item Risks \\
Eliminated some risk by:\\
	renting instead of building the factory\\
	buying instead of growing own apples\\
Workforce: lack of experience\\
Collaborators: \\
	\end{enumerate}
