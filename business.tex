\section{Executive summary}

business model = product (disguised as service for legal reasons - absolut?)

business objective
maximise sales
 - new to the market
   explain the required infrastructure to sell a lot

\section{Vision statement}

Our mission is to bring a mid priced cider to the people of India. India
has the second largest population in the world, and has an estimated market size
of 500 million alcohol consumers [better estimate]. At the moment, there is one
provider of cider in India, and we would like the change that.

We want to be a brewery. We will brew our own cider in the state of Himachal
Pradesh, which is the source of the majority of the apples in India. Along with
producing cider, we will sponsor other exclusive bars and clubs.

Operating in India which is well known for its corruption, we want to practice
ethical development. eg corrupt free, no bribes, no blood cider forced labour
fairtrade

We hope to gain popularity in major establishments, in Delhi and Mumbai through
the open minded youth and bar owners.

Our cider will become a desired commodity through exclusivity and we will be
able to research our market further at this point with minimal risk.

We will adapt and pick up popularity and scale up to make it available to the
public.

%please discuss even if you do not think it is an issue

poverty - provide jobs and food to the villagers. improve infrastructure (added benefits - tax exemptions)
religion - no issue, alcohol is still sold across all of india
corruption - no bribes, do everything by the books
age restriction - different restrictions for different states, alcohol content

\section{Introduction to the market}
\section{Products and services offered}
\section{Marketing plan}

\subsection{Route to Market}
Our proposed route to market begins with the launch of a microbrewery in [city].
[Explaination of our brewpub]
This will provide a self sustaining basis for market research


\subsection{Market Analysis}
\subsubsection{Current Competitors in the Cider Market}
At the moment, there is only one company which produces cider in India.
The company, Green Valley Cider, produces Tempest Cider in the state of Himachal
Pradesh, where they own several acres of apple orchards.

\subsubsection{Current Competitors in the Microbrewery Market}
\begin{itemize}
\item Rockman's Beer Island, Gurgaon - Located in the largest shopping mall in
			 Gurgaon (bordering New Delhi), Rockman's Beer Island was India's first
			 micro pub brewery. They offer four types of beer: Lager Strong Beer, Dark
			 Beer, Lager Beer and Wheat Beer, and they aim to serve some exclusive
 	     flavoured beers by the summer. Along with the micro pub brewery, they also
			 own an exclusive German restaurant and a digital auditorium covering an
	     area of around 3500 m$^2$. Rockman's are planning to expand now by opening
			 their branch in different locations in India.
\item Toit, Bangalore - Located in the Technology capital of India, Toit has been
			 doing really well since it has opened. They offer 6 different types of beers,
			 which are Toit's Basmati Blonde, Tintin Toit, Toit Weiss, Toit Red, Colonial
			 Toit and Toit's Dark Knight. They are currently in the process of introducing
			 exclusive Toit merchandise, along with their wide selection of food and alcohol.
			 Toit are planning on making the branch national by the end of this year.
\item The Biere Club, Bangalore - Another micro pub brewery which is located in
			 Bangalore, The Biere Club also brews around 6 different types of beers, which
			 include Lager, Ale and Wheat. The Biere Club are planning on making
			 partnerships with rich individuals for expansion in the future.
\item Doolally, Pune - Located in Pune, Doolally has been operational for around
			 three years. It is located in a boutique hotel, and plans to open in a few more
			 locations soon.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Conclusion}
As we can see, there is a large market for alcohol in India, who are eager to try
out new things, which can be seen by the successes of these microbreweries. As India
continues to grow to become a bigger powerhouse in the world, it will attract more
foreigners, which means that people who already know about cider and like it
will increase in the country. This increasing market size makes us believe that
cider will become increasingly popular in India once introduced properly.

\section{Advertising}
\subsection{Current Laws Affection Alcohol Advertising}
In the 90s, extensive surveys resulted in the conclusion that liquor advertisements
were directly influencing the consumer's purchasing behaviour, which led to the
introduction to new laws. Ever since the Cable Television Network Amendment Bill
came into effect on September 8$^{th}$ 2000, advertising alcoholic beverages on
television networks and billboards is completely banned in India.

\subsubsection{How the law has affected advertisment}
Although illegal, alcohol companies have found a way to spread their name through
the media by the use of surrogate advertisment. Surrogate Advertisement refers
to the form of advertisement which is used to promote banned producted, which is
alcohol in our case, in the disguise of another product.

Nearly all alcohol brands have now created other products which they use to advertise
their alcohol. Examples of this include Bagpiper Whiskey creating a Club Soda with
their brand name, Royal Stag creating Music CDs and Royal Challenge creating Mineral
Water and Music CDs.

\begin{figure}[h!]

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\caption{Royal Stag Music Advert which would commonly be seen on billboards}

		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{royalstagad1.png}
\end{figure}

Surveys say that over 80 people out of a 100 understand the actual liquor being
advertised, which means that it is still an effective way of advertising alcohol.

Although currently legal, the government is currently in the process of banning
surrogate advertisements. This is not certain to happen though.

\subsubsection{Alternate Methods of Advertisement}
With the future of surrogate advertising uncertain, some brands have moved to
the event sponsorship and organisation. Examples of this include Kingfisher
sponsoring many teams in the Indian Premier League. Many alcohol brands
have now started sponsoring many glamorous events to spread their name.

\end{figure}

\subsection{How We Plan to Advertise Our Product}
\subsubsection{Sponsoring Fashion Shows and Horse Races}
As the microbrewery and cider are new to the city, we would initially have to
spread the name out by spending big. We believe that the best way to do this is
by sponsoring Fashion Shows and Horse Races, as those are the places where we would
get the maximum number of people we are targetting, who are young people, females
and foreigners.
At the events we sponsor, we would get a limited number of bottles of cider produced
so that the people at these events could taste the cider. There would be large banners
around the location which would advertise the microbrewery. We would also hand out
discount coupons at these events which would encourage people to come to the
microbrewery.
By sponsoring these events, we will also obtain the membership data of many
people who would be our potential customers. As we would have phone numbers and
emails, we could send them texts and emails notifying them about the opening of
the microbrewery.

\subsubsection{Initial Discounts on Food and Alcohol}
To attract more people, for the first month of two of the opening of the microbrewery,
we would provide some discounts and offers on some alcohol and food. When people
get to know that they could go to a nice place which is cheaper than the other
places, they would be encouraged to do so. Hopefully, after providing a great first
experience, they would come back in the future.

\subsubsection{Placing Advertisements in the Local Newspapers}
Before opening the microbrewery, we would have to create awareness among the
people of the city that a new microbrewery would be opening up in the city. The
best way to reach to millions of people is by places an advertisement in a popular
newspaper. In the advertisement, we would mention the opening date of the
microbrewery, and also mention the fact that there would be discounts for a short
period of time which would attract more customers.

\subsubsection{Sponsoring Radio Shows}
Along with placing advertisements in newspapers, sponsoring a radio show would reach
out to a large number of people as well. A good time to sponsor a show would be
late night as we would want to target the younger people, who have a tendency to
be awake later than the older population.
\newpage

there is only one other provider of this product hence we see very low competition in this field

Introducing to bars, clubs and hotels in the major cities in India (Delhi, Mumbai, Goa,
Bangalore, Kolkata). Each city would give a different version of the cider, so we would
get a general idea of what the market prefers taste wise.

Low calorie cider?

Need to make other items with the saame brand name, because advertising is limited. Surrogate advertisement

Affiation with a charity? Provide consumers a "feel good" feeling while buying alcohol.

Corruption free

Use of TV and radio. around a billion people listen to the radio, so sponsor the primetime radio
show to spread the name.

Affiliation with the IPL. International market, so easy to introduce Indians to cider.

Cost based pricing vs Price based costing. Cant do competitive analysis, as no cider exists, but compete with
the local beers, etc. Price based costing wins btw.

\section{Product and systems development plans}
In order to setup a stable and longlasting infrastructure for our business we must take into consideration all the stages and requirements of production. This outlines a coherent development plan as follows.

	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Factory \\
When deciding about our homebase we considered two main criteria. The first regards our situation as a new company without assets. This brought the decision of renting out the factory bulding and equipment. The second criteria regards our main ingrediant requirements. Apples in India are available in the region of Himachal Pradesh. \\

For these reasons we will set our factory near Shimla, capital of Himachal Pradesh and rent the space and equipment necessary for production \\

\textbf{Quantities and Workforce} \\
For our marketing plan we require a relatively small production volume.\\
Workforce availability. \\

\textbf{Quality control}
We must ensure a good quality especially because it is a new product for this market..

	\item Ingredients for dry, sparkling cider, 10.5\% abv (per gallon of cider)
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Apples - 7kg
			\item Yeast (English Cider) - 2g
			\item Campden tablets - 1
		\end{itemize}

	\item Ingredients for sweet, sparkling cider,10.5\% abv (per gallon of cider)
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Apples - 7kg
			\item Yeast (Sweet Mead) - 2g
			\item Sugar - 250g
			\item Campden tablets - 1
		\end{itemize}

	\item Suppliers
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Apple supply \\
			Buy from local farmers %who?
        	Sell residue back to farmers for animals (or agree on lower price)
		\item (Potentially) mango, berries, pares etc. suppliers
		\item Water supply \\
			Divine Waters, Foods Beverages
		\item Sugar supply \\
		\item Chemical supply\\
			Preferably a specialized store selling brewing equipment and ingredients, eventually ship from overseas.
		\item Bottling \\
			Home brewers use beer bottles, which work perfectly well, and are inexpensive. This allows the cider to become naturally carbonated.
		\end{itemize}

\item Risks \\
Eliminated some risk by:\\
	renting instead of building the factory\\
	buying instead of growing own apples\\
Workforce: lack of experience\\
Collaborators: \\

\section{Capital requirements}

Since we aim at setting up a microbrewery to start with in Mumbai. We aim at choosing a location frequented by youth.
Hence renting an area in Lower Parel was chosen as this area is frequented alot by young drinkers willing to try new types of alcohol as if known for its night life.
Rent in this area is roughly about Rs.75/sqfoot per month.
As seen in the requirements:
the area of the kitchen would be estimated at: 300 sq/ft
area of the the actual sit out and bar would be about 2500 sq/ft allowing seating for about 60 people along with a nice bar are that would comfortably fit about 150 people.

Further we would require about 80 different types of spirits ranging from vodka to wine. Initially we would start with about 5 bottles each. On consulting a whole-seller this would cost about Rs 3,50,000 to 4,00,000.

The average cost of hiring waitors is about Rs. 1,00,000 a year we would require about 4 bar tenders 2 barbacks 5 waitors and servers.
A good chef being about Rs. 5,00,000 a year.
Along with this nightly security hire costs about Rs 50,000 annually.

We aim at advertising at horse racing events this has a cost of Rs. 5,00,000 though this number is high it has several benefits in doing so:

1) Conduct contests of skill and award prizes to the public to generate interest.
2) Advertise on the CCTV transmission at all centers .
3) Have full rights for on-site branding across the stands.
4) Name the race to suit its preference.
5) Have its CEO / nominee present the trophy.
6) Be entitled to the free use of lawns above a certain value of sponsorship.
7) Arrange for live entertainment at race time or before or after the event.
8) Promote and your brand the race via mailers/press.
9) Have access to the Club's membership data which consists of thousands of potential customers who represent some of the most well off clients in India.
10) Have promotion on the website with links to the lounges webpage.
11) Get coverage on a major television network as these races will be viewed world wide.



\section{Pricing}
We aim at pricing our cider at about Rs.250 which falls in line which most other mid range beer prices. Hence allowing people to try it as an alternative to beer as for a majority of indians it will be viewed in the same lines. Though this is slightly more expensive than other local beers like Kingfisher available at roughly between Rs150 - Rs.200 . But it does provide a level of slight level exclusivity much desired by the growing youth in Mumbai.

All other alcohols will be sold at the rate roughly found in and around similar pubs in the area. Which is usually sold at a mark up of about 350 percent.

Just to give an idea of expected prices we have attached a menu of cafe zoey a very popular and frequented lounge by several drinkers of all ages.
