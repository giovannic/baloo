  \subsection{Straff Recruitment}

The average cost of hiring for the skilled workers is about Rs. 1,00,000 a year we would require :
\begin{itemize}

\item 2 workers in charge of apple receival, washing and sorting  
\item 1 worker in charge of general cleaning of the area
\item 2 workers in charge of apple grating
\item 2 workers in charge of apple pressing
\item 2 workers in charge of apple pressing 

\end{itemize}

Further as required we will require a security guard which will cost about Rs. 50,000 a year.
 
  \subsection{Facilities}
Since we aim at setting up a microbrewery to start with in at a manufacturing area in Himachal Pradesh

Rent in this area is roughly about Rs.1 / ft$^2$ per month.
As seen in the requirements:

there is a storage area required this has been estimated to: 500 sq $^2$
area of for manufacturing the product would be 1500 ft$^2$ this is plenty to space to meet estimated current requirements

Lunch area and office space is estimated to be about 1000 $^2$ as well this as above well allows some space for hiring a few more employees if and when needed.

Hence yearly rent works out at Rs. 24,000 per year.
