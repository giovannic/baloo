\section{Executive Summary}
  \subsection{Overview}

  %A patented solution...
  %Vision to be...
Our mission is to bring a mid priced cider to the people of India. India has the second largest population in the world, and has an estimated market size of 500 million alcohol consumers [better estimate]. At the moment, there is one provider of cider in India, and we would like the change that. \\

\noindent We want to be a brewery. We will brew our own cider in the state of Himachal Pradesh, which is the source of the majority of the apples in India. Along with producing cider, we will sponsor other exclusive bars and clubs. \\

\noindent Operating in India which is well known for its corruption, we want to practice ethical development. eg corrupt free, no bribes, no blood cider forced labour fairtrade \\

\noindent We hope to gain popularity in major establishments, in Delhi and Mumbai through the open minded youth and bar owners. \\

\noindent Our cider will become a desired commodity through exclusivity and we will be able to research our market further at this point with minimal risk. \\

\noindent We will adapt and pick up popularity and scale up to make it available to the public.

  \subsection{Timeline}
After marketing planning and researching the development process we have decided upon a 7 month timeline for our business plan, encapsulating everything from setting up to starting to distribute out product. The latter constitutes the end point of our business plan and a stable milestone after which the company can be considered self sustainable. Following are the three mian stages of our timeline.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Licencing and building - 1 month \\
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Registr company
    \item Obtain brewing licence
    \item Rent space
    \item Setup utilities: contracts and infrastructure
  \end{itemize}

  \item Staff recruitment - 1 month
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Advertise job availability
    \item Process applications and interview applicants
    \item Start the training process as soon as we hire a qualified individual (brew master)
    \item Order equipment: it should have time to arrive by the time training is finished
    \end{itemize}

  \item Market research - 5 months
This phaze constitutes of daily iterations of the following sequence:
\begin{itemize}
\item Produce small quantities of a recipie variation (with an offset of 20 days for fermenting)
\item The professional taster tests the product and offers feedback
\item The team and brewmaster distribute to locals and collect feedback
\item The team and brewmaster reach out to distributers with samples of the product we are perfecting
\item File for a patent on our final recipe. 
\end{itemize}
\noindent After 5 months the recipie should be perfected and contracts with distributors signed. The only change that must be made at this point is upping the production scale to meet the request.
  \end{enumerate}

\section{Market Opportunity}

\subsection{Market Analysis}
  \subsubsection{Current Competitors in the Cider Market}
At the moment, there is only one company which produces cider in India. The company, Green Valley Cider, produces Tempest Cider in the state of Himachal Pradesh, where they own several acres of apple orchards.

  \subsubsection{Current Competitors in the Microbrewery Market}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Rockman's Beer Island, Gurgaon - Located in the largest shopping mall in Gurgaon (bordering New Delhi), Rockman's Beer Island was India's first micro pub brewery. They offer four types of beer: Lager Strong Beer, Dark Beer, Lager Beer and Wheat Beer, and they aim to serve some exclusive flavoured beers by the summer. Along with the micro pub brewery, they also own an exclusive German restaurant and a digital auditorium covering an area of around 3500 m$^2$. Rockman's are planning to expand now by opening their branch in different locations in India.
  \item Toit, Bangalore - Located in the Technology capital of India, Toit has been doing really well since it has opened. They offer 6 different types of beers, which are Toit's Basmati Blonde, Tintin Toit, Toit Weiss, Toit Red, Colonial Toit and Toit's Dark Knight. They are currently in the process of introducing exclusive Toit merchandise, along with their wide selection of food and alcohol. Toit are planning on making the branch national by the end of this year.
  \item The Biere Club, Bangalore - Another micro pub brewery which is located in Bangalore, The Biere Club also brews around 6 different types of beers, which include Lager, Ale and Wheat. The Biere Club are planning on making partnerships with rich individuals for expansion in the future.
  \item Doolally, Pune - Located in Pune, Doolally has been operational for around three years. It is located in a boutique hotel, and plans to open in a few more locations soon.
  \end{itemize}

  \subsection{The Opportunity for Shimla Gold Cider}
As we can see, there is a large market for alcohol in India, who are eager to try out new things, which can be seen by the successes of these microbreweries. As India continues to grow to become a bigger powerhouse in the world, it will attract more foreigners, which means that people who already know about cider and like it will increase in the country. This increasing market size makes us believe that cider will become increasingly popular in India once introduced properly.

  \subsection{Recipe}
We are planning to operate as a microbrewery producing small volumes of cider. We will start by conducting experiments and testing various recipes to find one which will be most suitable for Indian market. This testing phase significantly reduces our production power as we have to be able to operate quickly and modify recipes according to feedback.\\

\noindent We need two types of specialists to operate effectively as microbrewery. These are two initial recipes for our ciders, which we use to estimate cost and quantities of raw ingredients that will be needed. They are most likely to change, and both quantity and exact ingredients will vary depending on the cider recipe development process and the decisions of the brewing master.

		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Ingredients for dry, sparkling cider, 10.5\% abv (per gallon of cider) \\
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Apples - 7kg \\
					\item Yeast (English Cider) - 2g \\
					\item Campden tablets - 1 \\
				\end{itemize}

			\item Ingredients for sweet, sparkling cider,10.5\% abv (per gallon of cider) \\
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Apples - 7kg \\
					\item Yeast (Sweet Mead) - 2g \\
					\item Sugar - 250g \\
					\item Campden tablets - 1 \\
				\end{itemize}
			\end{enumerate}

  \subsection{Shimla Gold Cider's Unique Proposition}
Our product is proven cost effective and easy to implement. We have researched a number of recipies and asked one person about their home brewing experience. They clearly explained the process of brewing cider, which is straight forward and reasonably fast such that selling the produce can easily cover production cost and return profit in early stages.

%------------------------BUSINESS GROWTH AND RESOURCE PLANS--------------------%
\section{Business Growth and Resource Plans}
In order to setup a stable and longlasting infrastructure for our business we must take into consideration all the stages and requirements of production. Reaserching our cider recipe constituted the guideline and starting point of a coherent development plan. 

  \subsection{Current Structure and Resources}
  %Early phase centred on technology development
When deciding upon our homebase structure we considered firstly our situation as a new business, with no existing assets or experience, as well as a reasonable aim of setting up a small scale production line. \\

\noindent The favourable aspects of our current situation is our team of young, dynamic individuals, excited about implementig a good business idea. We are fast learners, on our way to obtaining university degrees, with a great tolerance to change and fully capabale of taking on unforseen obstacles without being overwhelmed by minor defeats. We believe a positive, persistent and energetic attitude towards implementig any business will yield a positive result and a great learning experience.

  \subsection{Straff Recruitment}
%The average cost of hiring for the skilled workers is about 1,00,000 a year we would require :

% Keep all the cost and finance information in one well defined section

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Qualified Brewmaster \\
He has to have previous experience with brewing various types of cider and would probably have to be recruited from a country with cider making traditions (France, England). He would serve as our cider making expert, being able to swiftly operate the equipment and professionally asses the quality of our cider. He must also supervise the general staff activity and behaviour.

  \item Microbiologist \\
He would serve as an assistant brewmaster, and would be responsible for conducting cider quality control tests, and performing microbiological analysis. He must also verify all the ingredients including the apples, sugar, yeast and water.
It is important to ensure a good quality especially considering the novelty of our product for this market.

  \item Unqualified labour \\
Our microbrewary requires manual labour as described below. These employees must work with the equipment we provide, attend to washing and maintaing it with resposability. Therefore brief training must be considered as a cost. \\ 
  2 workers in charge of apple receival, washing and sorting
  2 workers in charge of apple grating
  2 workers in charge of apple pressing
  1 worker in charge of general cleaning of the area

  \item Security guard \\
On top of general surveillence, he is in charge of verifying employee ids and greeting visitors.
  \end{enumerate}

% same here, all cost information in one place

% Further as required we will require a security guard which will cost about Rs. 50,000 a year.
 
  \subsection{Facilities}
    \subsubsection{Space requirements}
When deciding upon our homebase we considered firstly our situation as a new business, with no existing assets or experience, as well as the small scale of our production line. \\

We are aiming to brew \emph{15 gallons per day}. Whilst we will start off by brewing small qunatities in order to perfect the recipe, we must setup the scale which we need for efficient and profitable distribution. We have already identified the ingredients qunatity requirements per gallon when researching the recipies we will use and have explained how these might change. Using this information, these are the room size and functionality requirements we identified: \\

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Ingredients handling room \\
  This room must be easily accessible by our providers and large enough to store a week's worth of ingredients including:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item 1500L refrigerator to store 630Kg of apples
    \item 23kg of sugar
    \item yeast, campden tablets
    \end{itemize}
  The room must have a constant supply of water for washing apples and equipment. \\
  The room will operate a weekly pipeline of ingredients storage, however spare space must be available for unforseen situations.\\
  The room size must also allow washing, grating and pressing of apples which implies equipment and staff as detailed in the following sections.

  \item Brewing room \\
  This room must accomodate the two brewing systems for dry and sweet cider: aproximately $2m^3$ each. It must also be able to fit a desk and file cabinet for general office equipment.
  \item Fermenting room \\
  This room will operate a daily pipeline and must be able to accomodate a weeks worth of produce: $4m^3$. It must maintain a constant temperature of aproximately $22^\circ$C for fermentation. We have decided upon this as a good trade-off between quality and speed which are inveresely proportional: a lower fermenting temperature yelds higher quality but requires more time. However this is a specific decision the brewing master must make daily.

  \item Bottling and storage room \\
The bottling room must accomodate enough space to hold our 2 kegs/day as well as the bottles the cider goes into -- assuming we produce about 20 gallons a day in full production, that requires about 230 bottles a day. The space required for this is roughly $1m^3$. We then need to take into account how regularly we will receive pickups from distributors --about one week. This results in a room of at least $7m^3$ for storage, plus space to actually perform the bottling. \\
The bottling work will be done with the use of `bottling wands' which allow a consistent amount of cider to be poured per bottle, as well as keeping the cider from oxygenating. For our fizzy ciders, we will introduce about 3.3g of sugar per bottle to allow secondary fermentation to occur. These filled bottles are then handed off to a capper, who will place the caps on each bottle, use the bottle capper to tighten the caps and place them in to boxes for storage.

  \item Maintainance room\\
  This should be a small room for storing cleaning equipment. It should have access or be attached to a staff restroom.
  \end{enumerate}

    \subsubsection{Equipment requirements}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Production equipment
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Apple wash tub
      \item Apple crushing device
      \item Hand cracked cider press: small
      \item Mash tank: 15 gallon
      \item Sparge tank: 15 gallon
      \item Boil Kettle with a false bottom and a siphoning tube
      \item Chill wizzard with a cold water hoze and oxigen pump
      \item Fermenting tank with blow up valves for speedup: 15 gallon
      \item Propane burner
      \end{itemize}

    \item Storage equipment
      \begin{itemize}
      \item 1500L refridgerator for apple storage
      \item freezer for excess and spare apple woat
      \item Fermenting tanks: as mentioned above, in order to host the weekly pipeline, we require 7 15 gallon tanks and spares.
      \item bottles: we are aiming for a production line of 210 bottles daily therefore our weekly requirements is of aproximately 1300 bottles including spares
      \item boxes and lables
      \item shelves or containers ingredients (which come in their own boxes)
      \end{itemize}

    \item General maintainance equipment

        \end{itemize}
      \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}

%------------------------FINANCIAL PLAN AND FUNDING ASSUMPTIONS----------------%
\section{Financial Plan and Funding Assumptions}
  \subsection{Financial History}
  \subsection{Financial Projections}
Initially our main source of revenue would stem from sale of products in the short run once we aim at establishing our brand through adverstising and selling through pubs. Gradually we would like to further increase volume of sales and production and increase revenue through sponsors. In the long run we would like to further increase our product range including different flavours of ciders and gradually streamline our distribution process. This will all result in economies of scale hence reducing cost and added prodict range will increase volume of sales.

  \subsection{Use of Funds}
      \subsubsection{Staff Hiring and Property}
Since we aim at setting up a microbrewery to start with in at a manufacturing area in Himachal Pradesh

Rent in this area is roughly about Rs.1 / ft$^2$ per month.
As seen in the requirements:

there is a storage area required this has been estimated to: 500 sq $^2$ area of for manufacturing the product would be 1500 ft$^2$ this is plenty to space to meet estimated current requirements

Lunch area and office space is estimated to be about 1000 $^2$ as well this as above well allows some space for hiring a few more employees if and when needed.

Hence yearly rent works out at Rs. 24,000 per year.
   \subsubsection{Ingredients}
cost of sugar -  Rs.30 / kg
campden tables  - Rs.300 per 100 tablets
Sweet mead Rs.500 for /128 gms 


This brings the cost of dry cider to Rs. 5.866 per 330 ml
This brings the sweet of dry cider to Rs. 6.4 per 330 ml

%------------------------RISK ANALYSIS-----------------------------------------%
\section{Risk Analysis}

  \subsection{Risk Assessment and Management}
  Identyfying risks is mainly aimed at helping to outline a realistic budget requirement. Most of the items below are not avoidable, like staff illness or natural hazzards. However some are, and foreseeing even the unavoidable ones can make them more managable. Following is a comprehensive list of risks, including our approach to dealing with them.
   %Strong distribution channels minimise risk as does IP protection

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item human related
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Delaied production \\ Wheather it is because of suppliers delivering ingredients late or to do with the quality of the delivered product, we should have either a week's worth safety batch, which implies buying a freezer, or be prepared to deal with the cost of delaied production.
    \item Late distribution \\
The small scale of our buiness means space is limited which may cause a problem if buyers are late with picking up the merchandise. We should consider having an emergenci courier  or again be prepared to deal with the const of delaied production.
    \item Experience of employees \\
Providing a training session is sometimes insufficient for ensuring perfect performance from our employees. We must be prepared to deal with the cost of flawed batches.
    \item injuries, illness, misbehaviour \\
Anything that leads to an employee not being able to perform his tasks on a given day should be considered as a potential delay and extra cost. 
    \end{itemize}

  \item equipment related risks
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Break down
The extra cost that comes with machines breaking down can be reduced by a good warantee on each piece of equipment, insurance and availability of spare parts.
    \item Power cut
Whilst inevitable, this risk can be couterbalanced if our contract with unilities providers includes compensations for this type of situation. We must also ensure our production can endure a long standby time and again be able to handle the cost of potentially loosing a batch.
    \item Water contamination
%not sure about this
The scale of our business does not permit a water filtering system which means we must test the quality of the provided water daily.
    \end{itemize}

  \item ethical risks
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Working environment
    \item Religious employees
    \item Waste disposal
Waste disposal can be a sensitive issue with locals. Some of our waste may be have particularly unpleasant odor due to its biodegradable nature. We must try and find a way of donating apple residue to nearby farmers.
    \end{itemize}

\section{ANNEX 1}

%this is not an annex but a conclusion sumerising our learning outcomes
As a conclusion to our business proposition we would like to outline a few learning outcomes this experience has provided us with.\\

\noindent Fisrtly, being put in the situation of having to think about the implementation details of a business has shown us the benefits of being able to follow a well defined plan and the advantages of being organized as a team. Whilst the business idea might be fairly easy to explain, its implementation, however small the scale, raises an edless stream of problems to be solved and questiones to be answered which prove both the capacity and the limitations of human intuition. For this reason it is extreamly important to follow a rigurous plan and try to forsee as many risks as possible, as it is impossible to control the flow of events completely. \\

\noindent Secondly, we learnt there is much more to selling a product than making it available. Whilst a good product will advertise itself, tiit is important to sell the entire experience that goes with it and be prepared for both expantion or having to start over from scratch. Looking at success and failiure stories of other startups whilst trying to outline the plan for our own business developement, we saw that luck, whilst helpful, is replaceable with careful financial estimations, a pesimistic timeline and clever safety measures. \\

\noindent Finally, we saw that in order to make good use of resources and come accross as reliable the leading team must have well defined roles, in accordance with their skills. in order for potential investors to trust we can acomplish our goals, it is important to have a constant sense check when planning developement and remain realistic.\\

\noindent We consider this exercise to have been a worthwhile experience for having shown us a more comprehensive way of thinking about projects in general.
